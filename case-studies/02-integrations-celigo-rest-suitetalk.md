# NetSuite Integrations – Celigo, REST & SuiteTalk

## Business Context
The organization required automated data flow between NetSuite and external systems to support sales, inventory, and financial operations.

## My Role
I worked on functional and data mapping for integrations and supported testing, reconciliation, and error handling for inbound and outbound data.

## Key Responsibilities
- Defined field mappings for Sales Orders, Products, Inventory, Cancellations, and Refunds
- Used Celigo Integrator IO for API-based integrations
- Supported REST and SuiteTalk integration endpoints
- Validated incoming data and ensured financial and inventory accuracy
- Built reconciliation reports to confirm data sync

## Tools & Features
Celigo Integrator IO, REST API, SuiteTalk, Saved Searches, CSV, NetSuite

## Outcome
Automated integrations reduced manual entry, eliminated data mismatches, and improved order and inventory accuracy across systems.
